Per6-Chiu-ReversiPlayer
=======================

That game where you put tiles on the board and flip the ones between your tiles and that tile and that the computer always beats the player in

Compile and run Board.java in order to play the current prototype of the game.  This may not be the driver in the future!  Check back later.

Status:

-2P version of the game is operational

-AI is not

-Board predetermines all possible moves rather than checking them as they're requested -- important step in AI development

TO MR. K: When you see a hole in commits about the last week of May, that was the period in which I tried to get emacs' processing-mode to work with my machine.  I did!
