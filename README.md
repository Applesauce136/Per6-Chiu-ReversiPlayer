TO MR. K: When you see a hole in commits about the last week of May, that was the period in which I tried to get emacs' processing-mode to work with my machine.  I did!
Also, checkout DUEDATE to see the status of my project as of Monday, 9 June 2014, 8:29 am; no more commits shall go onto that branch, so you can see where I was.
The version I present may be a bit cleaner than the one on Monday, but the core implementation will be the same.
